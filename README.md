🌀 Sonic Drowning Music for WoW 🌊
"Gotta go fast... to the surface!" 💨
Ever felt that the default World of Warcraft breath meter is a bit... too chill? Does it lack that adrenaline-pumping urgency that tells you every millisecond counts?

This Addon brings the iconic (and terrifying) drowning music from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise directly into your WoW experience. When oxygen runs low, the panic begins!

✨ Features
Sonic Drowning Music silently monitors your breath meter. As soon as you hit the critical 13-second mark, the classic Sonic panic track kicks in.

Nostalgic Panic: Experience the same pressure you felt playing on the Sega Genesis.

Version Agnostic: Built with a smart logic that works across Retail, Classic Era, TBC, and Cataclysm.

Seamless Integration: Designed to work alongside major UI addons like RXP (RestedXP) and ElvUI. It automatically handles the different decimal time scales found in various game versions.
## Instalation
