# 🌀 Sonic Drowning Music for WoW
### *"Gotta go fast... to the surface!"* 💨

Ever felt that the default World of Warcraft breath meter is a bit... too chill? Does it lack that adrenaline-pumping urgency that tells you every millisecond counts?

This Addon brings the iconic (and terrifying) drowning music from the **Sonic the Hedgehog** franchise directly into your WoW experience. When oxygen runs low, the panic begins!

* **Version Agnostic:** Built with smart logic that works across **Retail, Classic Era, SOD, and Cataclysm**.
* **Seamless Integration:** Designed to work alongside major UI addons like **RXP (RestedXP)** and **ElvUI**.
* **Precision Timing:** Automatically handles the different decimal time scales found in various game versions to ensure the music syncs with your final gasps.
